We created this repository to potentially help other teams with the programming process. Both TeleOp and Autonomous programs are provided here and will be regularly updated for the newest game season. Please feel free to use portions of code from this or use our programs as a reference to build your own! Most of these programs can be intimidating to a new programmer, but if you take the time to properly learn them, it will be much easier.

Please note that some of the code isn't from the newer 2022-2023 game season and may be outdated by the time the on-season for 2022-2023 comes out.
